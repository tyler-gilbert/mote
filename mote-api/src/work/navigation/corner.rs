//! Reference-structure detection from one accumulated lidar revolution.
//!
//! Both reference structures are isosceles triangles with a 120-degree apex,
//! and each stands at least 0.25 m in front of anything behind it. In a
//! revolution, a structure is therefore a run of adjacent bins that opens with
//! an empty bin or a jump towards the robot and closes with an empty bin or
//! another jump.
//!
//! Walking along a run, the chord angle from its first point to each later
//! point holds steady along the first wall (0, 0, 0, ...) and sweeps once the
//! points turn onto the second wall (10, 20, 30, ...). The apex is the point
//! where that happens. Each wall is then fitted with a line, and the vertex is
//! their intersection.
//!
//! Before searching for the apex, a run must span the number of bins a
//! structure would at its distance. Each leg is [`STRUCTURE_LEG`] long, so the
//! edges are `2 * STRUCTURE_LEG * sin(60 deg)` apart. That full width faces the
//! robot from the arena centre; from the southeast and northwest corners the
//! line of sight is [`MAX_OFF_AXIS_VIEW`] off the bisector and the structure
//! looks narrowest.
//!
//! The detector works on the robot-frame points exposed by
//! [`Revolution::points`], keeping the lidar's clockwise angle convention out
//! of the geometry.
